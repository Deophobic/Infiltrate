    <h1>Education</h1>

    <div class="boxed">

        <p>We are all undergraduate students studying Computer Games Development at UWS Paisley.</p>
        <p>We are currently in our fourth year of University and were tasked with creating a website, to host the game we have designed and developed.</p>
        <p>We have similar previous coding knowledge in languages such as C#, Python ,HTML5 and Javascript.</p>
        <p>We are used to using software such as Unity and Unreal Engine before, so adapting to using phaser has been fun and challenging.</p>

    <h1>Task</h1>

    <div class="boxed">

    <p>This website was created using Webstorm by using HTML5, CSS and Javascript.</p>
    <p>Each person in the team is required to make a separate website but we are using the same Game Design Document which was created as a combined team effort.</p>
    <p>The second part of the project will be creating and implementing the game into the website using Phaser. </p>
    <p>The game will be playable on the "Game Page" webpage.</p>

    <h1>About me</h1>

    <div class="boxed">

    <p>Personally I have been playing video games since I was young which lead me to pursue a career in games.</p>
    <p>I would like to expose myself to many different genres of games and this time we picked a top down shooter as although they are simple visually and to make,</p>
    <p>I wanted to learn more about the depths of making it and how to make it more interesting.
        the rules behind them and how to implement them as well as exploring the more casual gaming experiences that suit people of all ages.</p>
    <p>I have played several top down games such as Furi and some flash games when I was younger.</p>
